# Rain in Australia
This project is a part of the [Applied Data Science master's program](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/masters-applied-data-science/) at the [University of San Diego](https://www.sandiego.edu).

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
This project aims to use different data mining techniques to compare each model's accuracy to each other and select the best model that can be used for the deployment phase. The project's scope is to analyze the weather in Australia from the given dates in the dataset, choose the best data mining model, and evaluate the performance of the model. The project will not go over the deployment phase.

## Project Description
The Rain in Australia dataset was published to make predictions on rainy days (Kaggle). Kaggle.com is the platform where this data was acquired. This dataset contains 23 variables, including the target variable RainTomorrow, and 145,460 observations, including a range of over ten years of data. The initial collection date started in November 2007 and the last day was in June 2017, and these include data from 49 different locations across Australia. The wind is another factor that is in this dataset but is divided into direction and speed. Other weather factors include rainfall, evaporation, and sunshine, which can be helpful to the model depending if these variables are correlated to the dependent variable. Additionally, the pressure, humidity, cloud, and temperature were recorded at different times throughout the same day. The last dependent variable, RainToday, recorded whether there was rain during the observation time.
